# The below is quite convoluted. A much simpler solution would have been to just make sure the input tables were nicely formated for R.

# Read the sheet called "SMALL_DATA" (experiment); specify a range to avoid extra header rows.

  "data/seminar_03_rachel_foster_microarray/DATA_RF_Rstudio.xlsx",
  sheet = "SMALL_DATA",

  rename(
    norm_10441 = `258493810002_1_2...2`, norm_10442 = 3, norm_10443 = 4,
    ndet_10441 = 5, ndet_10442 = 6, ndet_10443 = 7
  ) %>%
  # Make the table long, i.e. place the "norm_10441" labels in one column and the values in another.
  pivot_longer(2:7, names_to = 'n', values_to = 'v') %>%
  # Split the type of measurement and sample name
  separate(n, c('meas', 'sample'), sep = '_') %>%
  # Make the table a little wider, so each row has four columns: Probe ID, sample, norm and ndet
  pivot_wider(names_from = meas, values_from = v)

# Read the second sheet "BIG_DATA" that contains measurements from the South China Sea
big <- read_excel(
  "data/seminar_03_rachel_foster_microarray/DATA_RF_Rstudio.xlsx",

# having named rows with values.

) %>%
  # The above returns a "tibble", a sort of data.frame that can't have "rownames". To do what I aim to here, we need rownames,
  # so I first convert into a traditional data.frame, then move the name column into rownames.
  data.frame() %>%

  # Now, we can transpose the table, turning columns into rows and vice versa.

# Intro

# M & M

# Results

Look at the distribution of the small data
(`r figr('small-boxplot', T, type = 'Figure')`).

```{r small-boxplot, fig.cap = '**Distribution of small dataset.**'}
# Plot the distribution of the small dataset (norm values) as a violin with a boxplot inside.
small %>%
  filter(ndet >= 8) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = sample, y = norm)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1) +
  # Log scale is easy to apply
  scale_y_log10()
```

```{r}
# Another way of showing distributions is with histograms
small %>%
  filter(ndet < 8) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = norm)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~sample)
```

```{r}
# A simple NMDS ordination to see if samples separate

# First, use Vegan's metaMDS() function to calculate the NMDS. It takes a matrix with samples as rows and items, in this case, probes
# as columns.
nmds <- big %>%
  # Select the columns we need and log transform the norm values
  transmute(probe = `Probe ID`, sample, lognorm = log10(norm)) %>%
  # Make it wide, i.e. the matrix we need
  pivot_wider(names_from = probe, values_from = lognorm) %>%
  # We need to turn the sample names into "rownames"
  data.frame() %>%
  tibble::column_to_rownames('sample') %>%
  # Call the metaMDS function with default values
  vegan::metaMDS()

# To plot the values, get the points vectors and turn into a data.frame
data.frame(nmds$points) %>%
  # Rownames are sample names, make explicit
  tibble::rownames_to_column('sample') %>%
  # Join in the samples to use variables for colouring and for shapes
  inner_join(samples, by = 'sample') %>%
  # Pipe into ggplot and plot as points.
  ggplot(aes(x = MDS1, y = MDS2, colour = as.integer(Depth), shape = Station)) +
  geom_point()
```
